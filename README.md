## **Dataset**
The dataset used for training the climate change chatbot consists of structured question-answer pairs covering various aspects of climate science, causes, effects, mitigation strategies, and policies. It is designed to improve chatbot interactions by mapping user queries to relevant responses using predefined tags.

### **Structure of the Dataset**
The dataset is organized into four main fields:

1. Questions: Commonly asked user queries related to climate change.

2. Answers: Corresponding responses providing accurate and concise information.

3. Patterns: Alternative phrasings of the questions to enhance the chatbot‚Äôs ability to recognize diverse user inputs.

4. Tags: Categorization labels that group similar topics, enabling efficient intent recognition.

## **Data Format**
The dataset is stored in JSON format, which allows efficient processing for training a Transformer-based chatbot.

## **Why This Dataset?**
- Covers key climate change topics including causes, effects, solutions, policies, and scientific concepts.

- Provides diverse question variations to enhance chatbot accuracy.

- Enables intent classification for better user interaction.

- Supports easy expansion for improved chatbot performance over time.

This dataset serves as the foundation for training the chatbot, ensuring that it can provide informative and contextually relevant responses to users‚Äô climate-related queries.
